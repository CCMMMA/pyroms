This is for remapping the old and new Hill runoff files to ROMS and MOM6.

The old files are on a two-dimensional grid for which xesmf remapping works. The new files only have the
runoff points making the source grid unstructured and beyond the means of xesmf. However, the operation we need
is much like that in move_river_t.

For ROMS, you need to first run:

    python maskedge.py > maskedge.out

The runoff years are now being done using the runmpi.chinook script.
Beware: the ROMS add_rivers.py has grid dimensions hard-coded - these need to be correct or else.

In ROMS, I'm making a separate river_tracers.nc file for T and S and whatever BGC tracers are being used:

    python add_temp.py Hill_rivers_2016.nc river_tracers.nc


TODO:

1. Fix add_rivers.py to figure out grid dimensions some other way.

2. The move_river_t/remap_rivers routines should figure out the remapping indices once and save them for later.

3. The xesmf remapping plus move_river_t can be combined into one remap_rivers operation for the "old" Hill files.

4. The remap_rivers is a Fortran routine and these will need a new way to be called at some point when the old way disappears.
